# Crowdfunding_ETL

For this ETL project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. The transformed data was then exported into four CSV files which were used to create an ERD and a table schema. Once the database and table schemas were created in Postgres, the data from the CSV files were imported into each corresponding table.

Folder Structure:

    Database: Crowdfunding ERD and Schema
    Code: ETL Code
    Resources: Excel files used to import into ETL code and exported CSV files to import into Postgres
